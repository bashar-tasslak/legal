<h1>Amman Tutors Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated: October 20, 2025</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to Amman Tutors! By using our Service, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Application</strong> – The Amman Tutors software program provided by the Company.</li>
    <li><strong>Company</strong> – Amman Tutors (“We”, “Us”, “Our”).</li>
    <li><strong>Device</strong> – Any device that can access the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Service</strong> – The Amman Tutors platform connecting students and tutors.</li>
    <li><strong>You</strong> – The user accessing the Service (either as a Student or a Tutor).</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Age Requirement</h2>
<p>Users must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use the Service. Users under 18 may only use the Service with parental or guardian consent.</p>

<h2>3. Role of the Company</h2>
<p>Amman Tutors is a <strong>connector and facilitator</strong> — not an employer, agency, or representative of any Tutor or Student. The platform’s role is limited to providing a digital space where Students can find and communicate with independent Tutors.</p>

<p><strong>Tutors are not employees, contractors, or agents of Amman Tutors.</strong> Each Tutor operates independently and is solely responsible for their teaching quality, content, communication, and pricing.</p>

<p>The Company does not control, supervise, or endorse any Tutor’s qualifications, methods, or results. Any agreements, payments, or disputes between Students and Tutors are strictly between those parties.</p>

<h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provide accurate and up-to-date information when creating an account.</li>
    <li>Maintain account confidentiality and responsibility for all activities under your account.</li>
    <li>The Company may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms or misuse of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Payments</h2>
<p>Payments currently occur <strong>outside the Application</strong> between Students and Tutors. Amman Tutors does not process, hold, or manage funds on behalf of users.</p>
<p>The Company is not responsible for any payment disputes, refunds, or unfulfilled agreements between Students and Tutors.</p>

<h2>6. User Conduct</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Do not engage in harassment, discrimination, or offensive behavior.</li>
    <li>Do not use the Service to promote academic dishonesty or cheating.</li>
    <li>Do not upload or transmit harmful, illegal, or misleading content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time if users violate these Terms or misuse the platform.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>Amman Tutors provides the Service as a matching platform only. We are not responsible for any direct or indirect losses, including but not limited to academic results, scheduling conflicts, payment issues, or tutor performance.</p>
<p>Total liability for any claim related to the Service shall not exceed USD $100.</p>

<h2>9. “AS IS” Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without any warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee continuous or error-free operation.</p>

<h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Users agree to attempt informal resolution by contacting us before pursuing legal remedies.</p>
<p>📧 Contact: <a href="mailto:admin@bashartasslak.com">admin@bashartasslak.com</a></p>

<h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may revise these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after updates constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
